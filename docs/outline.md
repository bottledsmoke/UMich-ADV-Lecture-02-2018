## FLAT SHADING
I don't think it's 'flat shaded' that the OP loves, as much as "simple geometry that's not concealed or obscured by complex textures"

Flat shader but with Global Illumination / Ambient Occlusion / slight Depth of Field while using only a single light source to act as sunlight:
 
Straight flat render, no effects, but with multiple lights to act as fills, etc (otherwise it'd be pitch black inside the cave):

Global Illumination (GI) is a system that models how light is bounced off of surfaces onto other surfaces (indirect light) rather than being limited to just the light that hits a surface directly from a light source (direct light).
