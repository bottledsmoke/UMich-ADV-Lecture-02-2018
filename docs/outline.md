# ABS vs PLA

Use a raft and make sure build plate is level.
Follow settings in the file Evan has.

Print at Ultra quality if you have the time. 

Thing to test I guess

## PLA 
works with a wide variety of applications because of its easy of use. 
Less resistant to temperature changes in the environment
Great surface quality
Not great for products that will undergo a lot of use or be exposed to the elements
Can handle more weight before breaking
more forgiving with complex features. Can print up to 60° overhang
Prints bridges more reliably.

## ABS
Trickier to print with (more sensitive to temperature changes in the environment).
Need an enclosure and a heated build plate for better chances of success.
If it cools too rapidly, prints can crack along layer lines. 
More susceptible to warping and curving during print process.
Can handle more stress, temperature, and pressure than PLA. Better for wear and tear.
Will distort and bend before breaking
Can only print up to 45° vertical overhang.


# FLAT SHADING
Flat shading is not simply exposing the underlying geometry. It just looks bad. It’s not flat shading you love. It’s simple geometry that is not concealed or obscured by complex textures or maps.

IMG 1
Flat Shader but with Global Illumination / Ambient Occlusion / slight Depth of Field while using only a single light source to act as sunlight:
 
IMG 2
Straight flat render, no effects, but with multiple lights to act as fills, etc (otherwise it'd be pitch black inside the cave):


Unity definition of GI

Global Illumination (GI) is a system that models how light is bounced off of surfaces onto other surfaces (indirect light) rather than being limited to just the light that hits a surface directly from a light source (direct light).
