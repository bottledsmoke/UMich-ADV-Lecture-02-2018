Educational Licenses
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.allegorithmic.com/education - free for a year
http://pixologic.com/ - half off ZBrush. License lasts forever afaik. 
https://www.maxon.net/en-us/training/educational-solutions/educational-solutions/students/ - Cinema4d (free for I don’t know how long). Pretty decent modeler. Very good for motion graphics. 
https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini-education/ - Houdini - $75/yr. Decent modeler. Industry leader in simulations. 
https://www.foundry.com/industries/education/students-graduates - Modo $262 w/ Nuke, CaraVr, and Mari. Great deal.
https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/maya - Maya (free), but you’re locked into Autodesk’s talons once you go down this road. 

Free, really solid map baker for Windows. The lovely Canooks at Capybara use it.

And, if you don’t want to pay $$ for Maya, Modo, or C4D, Blender will always be free.
https://www.blender.org/

Also, Da Vinci Resolve is a free, commercial-grade video and sound editing suite. Just throwing that out there in case you don’t already own Logic and Avid.

Warren Marshall - 15 years at Epic Games (Unreal Engine) (modo, substance, zbrush)

Pat Crandley - Professor that uses Modo in Sacramento. Full courses for free

Peter Stammbach - Modo Modeler that sounds like Werner Herzog
https://www.youtube.com/user/stammpe2

Tor Fricke - in the running for the best 3D modeler in the world. Uses Modo. Models super, super fast. Not very educational if you don’t know what’s going on, but you can pick up a lot of tricks once you know your way around Modo. 
https://www.youtube.com/user/Askguden

Expensive, top-tier tutorials from the best in the biz covering pretty much everything in the art sphere. I’m not kidding when I say expensive.

The Foundry’s official tutorials for Modo. There’s some architecture ones in there too where they build the Eames house (but not the Eames chair) that might interest you.
