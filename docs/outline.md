# ABS vs PLA

Use a raft and make sure build plate is level.
Follow settings in the file Evan has.
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:269637
Print at Ultra quality if you have the time. 

Thing to test I guess

## PLA 
works with a wide variety of applications because of its easy of use. 
Less resistant to temperature changes in the environment
Great surface quality
Not great for products that will undergo a lot of use or be exposed to the elements
Can handle more weight before breaking
more forgiving with complex features. Can print up to 60° overhang
Prints bridges more reliably.

## ABS
Trickier to print with (more sensitive to temperature changes in the environment).
Need an enclosure and a heated build plate for better chances of success.
If it cools too rapidly, prints can crack along layer lines. 
More susceptible to warping and curving during print process.
Can handle more stress, temperature, and pressure than PLA. Better for wear and tear.
Will distort and bend before breaking
Can only print up to 45° vertical overhang.


Educational Licenses
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

https://www.allegorithmic.com/education - free for a year
http://pixologic.com/ - half off ZBrush. License lasts forever afaik. 
https://www.maxon.net/en-us/training/educational-solutions/educational-solutions/students/ - Cinema4d (free for I don’t know how long). Pretty decent modeler. Very good for motion graphics. 
https://www.sidefx.com/products/houdini-education/ - Houdini - $75/yr. Decent modeler. Industry leader in simulations. 
https://www.foundry.com/industries/education/students-graduates - Modo $262 w/ Nuke, CaraVr, and Mari. Great deal.
https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/maya - Maya (free), but you’re locked into Autodesk’s talons once you go down this road. 

Free, really solid map baker for Windows. The lovely Canooks at Capybara use it. 
http://www.xnormal.net/

And, if you don’t want to pay $$ for Maya, Modo, or C4D, Blender will always be free.
https://www.blender.org/

Also, Da Vinci Resolve is a free, commercial-grade video and sound editing suite. Just throwing that out there in case you don’t already own Logic and Avid.

Old but solid Z-Brush pipeline. ZRemesher is better now. It was upgraded with version 4R7 (4R8 is the current version).

Allegorithmic’s free books on Physically Based Rendering. Why not?
https://www.allegorithmic.com/pbr-guide

Allegorithmic’s tutorials. Pretty good.

Warren Marshall - 15 years at Epic Games (Unreal Engine) (modo, substance, zbrush)
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5dRrOarPI6ufGWsabG28FQ

Pat Crandley - Professor that uses Modo in Sacramento. Full courses for free
https://www.youtube.com/user/patcran

Peter Stammbach - Modo Modeler that sounds like Werner Herzog
https://www.youtube.com/user/stammpe2

Tor Fricke - in the running for the best 3D modeler in the world. Uses Modo. Models super, super fast. Not very educational if you don’t know what’s going on, but you can pick up a lot of tricks once you know your way around Modo. 
https://www.youtube.com/user/Askguden

Expensive, top-tier tutorials from the best in the biz covering pretty much everything in the art sphere. I’m not kidding when I say expensive. 
https://www.thegnomonworkshop.com/

Michael Pavlovich - Z-brush tutorials posted as often as your sorority friend tweets. Works incredibly fast.

# FLAT SHADING
Flat shading is not simply exposing the underlying geometry. It just looks bad. It’s not flat shading you love. It’s simple geometry that is not concealed or obscured by complex textures or maps.

IMG 1
Flat Shader but with Global Illumination / Ambient Occlusion / slight Depth of Field while using only a single light source to act as sunlight:
 
IMG 2
Straight flat render, no effects, but with multiple lights to act as fills, etc (otherwise it'd be pitch black inside the cave):


### Unity definition of GI
Global Illumination (GI) is a system that models how light is bounced off of surfaces onto other surfaces (indirect light) rather than being limited to just the light that hits a surface directly from a light source (direct light).
